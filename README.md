## Welcome to Bucketlist!

Check off and complete your wish list with friends, and keep all your memory without regret.

Bucketlist provides the ability to create an interactive list of activities you may want to accomplish. With this list, you can connect with old and new friends to complete these activities and live a more fulfilled life. Many times, we want to do things but never do them. Bucketlist is intended to get people out and to accomplish their goals. With the help of social connection and common interests, users can connect and live the life they want to live instead of daydreaming but never doing.

Through social connection and event tracking and planning we can all reach our goals. Not only will your upcoming events be available on your bucket list, you can also view your friends upcoming events too! We hope you can check off your list and try fun activities you might not have thought about!
